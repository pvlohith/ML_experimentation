# ML_experimentation
• Experimented with most of the machine learning algorithms like regression(linear and logistic), KNN, 
  Decision trees, K-means,SVM Generalized linear model, Artificial Neural networks 
• Performed dimensionality reduction using feature selection and feature extraction(PCA,ICA)
• Analyzed the efficacy of each algorithm through accuracy score, learning curves, confusion matrix, computational time.
